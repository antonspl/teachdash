# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: R11 Application pages

The web client SHALL redirect the root path by login state and role (see `web-auth`
R2) and SHALL show a not-found page for any path it does not know, including when that
path is opened directly. A missing file under `/assets/` SHALL be a real 404, so a stale
page fails visibly instead of loading HTML as a script. `/robots.txt` and `/favicon.ico`
SHALL also be real 404s.

#### Scenario: web-client/R11-S1 Root path opens the login page for an anonymous user
- **GIVEN** the local stack is running and the user is not logged in
- **WHEN** a user opens `/`
- **THEN** the login page is shown with the application name

#### Scenario: web-client/R11-S2 Unknown path opened directly shows the not-found page
- **GIVEN** the local stack is running
- **WHEN** a user opens `/no-such-page` directly
- **THEN** the response is the web application, not a server error page
- **AND** the not-found page is shown

#### Scenario: web-client/R11-S3 Missing asset is a real 404
- **GIVEN** the local stack is running
- **WHEN** a client requests `/assets/no-such-file.js`, `/robots.txt` or `/favicon.ico`
- **THEN** the response status is 404
- **AND** the response is not the web application's HTML

### Requirement: R12 Backend reachability warning

The login page SHALL warn when the backend cannot be reached and SHALL show no warning
when it can. A successful JSON response or a complete problem response means reachable.
A network failure, a dropped or hung response or any other response means unreachable.
The page SHALL check once on load and again when the tab becomes visible or the browser
comes back online, and SHALL NOT poll on a timer. The checks SHALL NOT send the session
cookie, so they never extend a session.

#### Scenario: web-client/R12-S1 Reachable backend shows no warning
- **GIVEN** the local stack is running and the user is not logged in
- **WHEN** a user opens `/login`
- **THEN** the page shows no "unreachable" warning

#### Scenario: web-client/R12-S2 Backend cannot be reached
- **GIVEN** the status request fails with a network error, or returns a 502 that is not a problem response, or returns a 200 with HTML, or returns a 200 with JSON whose body drops or hangs
- **WHEN** the login page is rendered
- **THEN** the page shows the translated "unreachable" warning

#### Scenario: web-client/R12-S3 Status check does not send the session cookie
- **GIVEN** the local stack is running and the browser holds a `SESSION` cookie
- **WHEN** the login page sends a status request
- **THEN** the request has no `Cookie` header with that session

#### Scenario: web-client/R12-S4 Page checks again when the tab is shown, and not on a timer
- **GIVEN** the login page shows the "unreachable" warning and the tab is hidden
- **WHEN** a long time passes, and then the tab becomes visible and the backend now answers
- **THEN** no status request is sent before the tab is visible
- **AND** the warning disappears without a reload

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: R2 Translated UI strings

Every string the web client shows to a user SHALL come from the translation resources.
English is the only UI language for now.

#### Scenario: web-client/R2-S1 Page text comes from the translation resources
- **GIVEN** the translation resources are replaced with test values
- **WHEN** the login page and the not-found page are rendered
- **THEN** each page shows the test values
- **AND** no English text from the real resources is shown

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: R1 Application pages
**Reason**: The root path no longer shows a placeholder page; it redirects by login state and role. OpenSpec cannot drop a scenario from a modified requirement, so the requirement is replaced.
**Migration**: Replaced by R11 Application pages. R1-S2 and R1-S3 continue unchanged as R11-S2 and R11-S3; their tests are renamed.

### Requirement: R3 Backend reachability status
**Reason**: The placeholder page is removed; the reachability check moves to the login page and becomes a warning shown only when the backend cannot be reached.
**Migration**: Replaced by R12 Backend reachability warning, with the same checking rules; tests move from the placeholder page to the login page.
